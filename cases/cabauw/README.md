# Cabauw test case with (LS)2D input
Simple Cabauw test case for the land-surface model and/or radiation.
The included (LS)2D input (`ls2d_20160815_0600_1800`) is for the 15th of August 2016.

Running the case requires:
- `microhh_tools.py` from the `microhh_root/python` directory.
- `van_genuchten_parameters.nc` from the `microhh_root/misc` directory.
- The correctly linked RRTMGP coefficient files. See the RCEMIP readme for details.
