# Cabauw - 11 August 2018 case

## Case description
Reference case for shallow cumulus over Cabauw.

NOTE: the input in `cabauw_input_hr.nc` (from LS2D) is the raw data from ERA5. In order to get the surface energy balance in line with the observations, a better guess for the initial soil moisture content is (from bottom to top): `[0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.35]`.
