[MPI]
clean up MPI, such that code can be compiled without
back out fourier transform from pressure to grid function such that unnecessary transposes are not made for serial or 1D parallel runs

[performance]
implement fftw_many
vectorize 4th order pressure solver
integrate advection and diffusion

[structure]
handle field registration properly

[extensions]
compute basic statistics

[dynamical core]
loop on time or on iterations

[multiprocessing]
implement CUDA

[LES]
implement surface model
implement smagorinsky
