# use H.264 compression to create very high quality and small file size movies (use avconv or ffmpeg). 
# framerate is the fps of the movie
# r is the number of frames per second in the output, leading to duplicates in case framerate < r
#
# ONE PASS FILTERING (aim for constant quality)
# crf is quality (0 is lossless, 15 is very good, 23 is standard)

# TWO PASS FILTERING (aim for constant bitrate)
# b:v is the bitrate (for high quality use 10000k for 720p and 16000k for 1080p)
