# use H.264 compression to create very high quality and small file size movies (use avconv or ffmpeg). 
# crf is quality (0 is lossless, 15 is very good, 23 is standard), framerate is the fps of the movie
# r is the number of frames per second in the output, leading to duplicates in case framerate < r
